    "Bayesian inference begins with specification of a probability model relating unknown variables to data. PyMC3 provides the basic building blocks for Bayesian probability models: stochastic random variables, deterministic variables, and factor potentials. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **stochastic random variable** is a factor whose value is not completely determined by its parents, while the value of a **deterministic random variable** is entirely determined by its parents. Most models can be constructed using only these two variable types. The third quantity, the **factor potential**, is *not* a variable but simply a\n",

A `Factor` is used whenever a variable contributes a log-probability term to a model. Hence, you know a variable is a subclass of `Factor` whenever it has a `logp` method, as we saw in the previous section.\n",

Also, we passed the value to be evaluated by the `logp` function as a **dictionary**, rather than as a plain integer.

Points in parameter space are represented by dictionaries with parameter names as they keys and the value of the parameters as the values.\n",

This function may employ other random variables in its calculation. \n",

As an example, fields like psychology and astrophysics have complex likelihood functions for a particular process that may require numerical approximation. In these cases, it is impossible to write the function in terms of predefined theano operators and we must use a custom theano operator using `as_op` or inheriting from `theano.Op`. \n",

The idea is to first sample from the conditional distribution for $y$ (i.e., $Pr(x)$) given some current value of $x$, which is uniform over the $(0,f(x))$, and conditional on this value for $y$, then sample $x$, which is uniform on $S = {x : y < f (x)}$.\n",

In this case, the auxiliary variable becomes $z = log(y) = g(x_i) − e$, where $e \\sim \\text{Exp}(1)$, resulting in the slice $S = \\{x : z < g(x)\\}$.\n",

If we are interested in modelling, say, population size as a function of the count and the associated covariates, it is difficult to accommodate the second observation because the temperature is missing (perhaps the thermometer was broken that day). Ignoring this observation will allow us to fit the model, but it wastes information that is contained in the other covariates.\n",
